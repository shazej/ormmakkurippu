# Ormmakkurippu: Turning Customer Calls into Scheduled Action

## 1. The Real-World Problem: The "Post-Call Chaos"
In a fast-paced business, a phone call is rarely just a conversation—it’s a commitment. You're driving, in a meeting, or handling another task when a client calls with a critical request. You take a quick note, promise a follow-up, and hang up. 

Then, the chaos begins. That note gets lost, the "mental bookmark" fades, and the "I'll do it later" task disappears into the daily grind. This is **Cognitive Leakage**: the hidden cost of manual follow-up that leads to missed deadlines, frustrated clients, and personal stress.

## 2. From Noise to Structure: The Core Workflow
Ormmakkurippu (Meaning "Memory Note") bridges the gap between a conversation and its execution.

*   **Capture**: The moment you hang up, the app prompts you to log the call. No more "I'll remember this later."
*   **Notes**: Capture the nuance. Was the client frustrated? Is the deadline firm? Log it while it's fresh.
*   **Responsibility**: Instantly tag a team member or yourself. The system transforms a vague "we need to fix this" into a concrete "John must fix this."

## 3. Evidence-Based Execution: Handling Attachments
A task is only as good as its context. Ormmakkurippu allows you to snap a photo of a site issue, record a quick voice memo, or upload a client’s document directly to the task.
*   **Google Drive Integration**: All evidence is automatically filed into a dedicated "Ormmakkurippu" folder in your Google Drive. 
*   **Shared Truth**: Your team doesn't just see a task; they see the evidence—the "before" photo or the specific PDF the client mentioned—synchronized and ready.

## 4. The Final Layer: Google Calendar Sync
A task without a time is just a wish. Ormmakkurippu treats your schedule as the final source of truth.
*   **Automatic Scheduling**: Once a task is created, it is pushed to your Google Calendar. 
*   **Visibility**: It appears as a dedicated slot or reminder, ensuring that "following up with Client X" is treated with the same respect as a board meeting. You don't "look for tasks"—your calendar tells you what’s next.

## 5. Daily Relief: Removing the Mental Load
The goal isn't just "task management"; it's **Mental Liberation**. 
By offloading the "remembering" to the system, you reclaim your focus. You no longer need to scan your brain for what you forgot; you simply look at your dashboard or your calendar. For a founder or service owner, this means going home without the nagging feeling that something slipped through the cracks.

## 6. The AI Advantage: Your Intelligent Assistant
Ormmakkurippu leverages AI to turn messy inputs into professional outputs:
*   **Summarization**: AI parses your quick, shorthand notes into a clear, professional summary.
*   **Extractions**: It automatically identifies action items and deadlines from the call context.
*   **Smart Reminders**: AI suggests the best time to schedule the follow-up based on your urgency and previous patterns.
